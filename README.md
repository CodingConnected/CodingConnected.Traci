# CodingConnected.TraCI

Currently, this repository is home to two independent implementations of the TraCI protocol (see http://sumo.dlr.de/wiki/TraCI):

- TraCI.NET offers a partial implementation of TraCI in C#/.NET
- TraCI.C offers an even partialler implementation of TraCI in native (ANSI) C (for now, this is Windows only)

Both implementations are currently oriented exclusively on connecting external traffic controllers to SUMO, and therefor cover only a small portion of the TraCI API.
